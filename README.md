# MediaPipe Program
## Pose Detector

The two programs pushups.py and render.py are able to seperately detect
and analyse the users exercise reps through the device camera. 

It will count the number of reps done, and will have a seperate counter for
any bad reps. 

TODO:
- refactor code so that mode of exercise can be chosen by user
- clean up
- add documentation
